## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I almost skipped this project because it's so simple, but it was still great practice to develop my workflows and see how quickly I can complete projects.

I also added an additional breakpoint for smaller screen sizes.


### Continued development

I plan to do more Frontend Mentor projects to continue developing my speed and workflow using my own custom snippets and starter templates. I will also start to use Tailwind CSS and looking forward to incorporating React for more interactive challenges.
